# Development Guide

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the Hunty frontend development guide. This is your friendly walkthrough for getting the Hunty web app up and running on your machine. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or just exploring the codebase, this guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

Before we dive in, make sure you have these installed on your computer:

**Node.js and npm** (or yarn/pnpm if you prefer)
- You'll need Node.js version 18 or higher
- Check if you have it: `node --version` and `npm --version`
- If not, grab it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

**A code editor**
- VS Code is popular, but use whatever you're comfortable with
- We recommend having the ESLint and Prettier extensions installed

**Git** (for version control)
- Most developers already have this, but if not: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

That's it! No need for Rust or Stellar CLI here - that's for the smart contracts. We're just building the web interface.

### Setting Up the Project

First things first, let's get the code on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samuel1-ona/hunty.git
   cd hunty
   ```

2. **Install all the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   #  pnpm
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
 
   # 
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should see the Hunty landing page!

That's it! The dev server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code. Pretty neat, right?

## How We Work Around Here

### Starting a New Feature

When you're ready to add something new or fix a bug, here's the workflow we follow:

1. **Create a new branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature
   # or for bug fixes
   git checkout -b fix/that-annoying-bug
   ```
   This keeps your work separate from the main code until it's ready.

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Edit the files you need to change
   - Test it in your browser (the dev server should auto-reload)
   - Make sure everything looks good and works as expected

3. **Check for any issues:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run lint
   ```
   This will catch any code style problems or potential bugs.

4. **Build it to make sure everything compiles:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```
   If this works, you're good to go!

5. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add awesome new feature that does X"
   git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature
   ```

Then create a pull request on GitHub so others can review your work. We're all about collaboration here!

### Running the App

**Development mode** (with hot reload):
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
This starts the Next.js dev server with Turbopack. Changes you make will show up instantly in your browser.

**Production build** (to test how it'll work when deployed):
```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```
This builds an optimized version and runs it locally. Good for catching issues before deployment.

**Linting** (checking code quality):
```bash
pnpm run lint
```
This runs ESLint to catch potential problems and style issues. Fix any errors before committing!

## Understanding the Codebase

Let's take a quick tour of how everything is organized. Don't worry, it's not as complicated as it might seem!

### The Big Picture

This is a Next.js app using the App Router (the newer way Next.js does routing). Everything lives in the `app/` directory, and components are in `components/`.

### Main Pages

**`app/page.tsx`** - This is the landing page
- The "Game Arcade" homepage where users first land
- Shows available hunts and lets users connect their wallet
- Has the "Create Game" and "Play Game" buttons

**`app/hunty/page.tsx`** - The game creation page
- Where hunt creators build their scavenger hunts
- Has tabs for creating clues, setting rewards, and publishing
- Also shows the leaderboard when you're viewing a completed game

### Key Components

**`components/Header.tsx`** - The top navigation bar
- Shows the Hunty logo
- Has wallet connection button (when not connected)
- Shows wallet address and balance (when connected)

**`components/WalletModal.tsx`** - The wallet connection popup
- Currently empty (we removed Starknet wallets)
- This is where you'll add Stellar wallet integration later

**`components/PlayGame.tsx`** - The actual game playing interface
- Shows hunt cards one at a time
- Lets players enter codes to unlock clues
- Handles the game flow from start to completion

**`components/HuntCards.tsx`** - Individual hunt clue cards
- The visual cards that show each clue
- Handles answer input and verification
- Shows hints and images

**`components/CreateGameTabs.tsx`** - Tab navigation for game creation
- Switches between Create, Rewards, Publish, and Leaderboard tabs

**`components/HuntForm.tsx`** - Form for adding clues
- Where creators input questions, descriptions, links, and answer codes

**`components/RewardsPanel.tsx`** - Reward configuration
- Lets creators set up XLM or NFT rewards
- Shows reward tiers and amounts

### UI Components

Everything in `components/ui/` is a reusable component built on Radix UI:
- `button.tsx` - Buttons with different variants
- `dialog.tsx` - Modal dialogs
- `input.tsx` - Text inputs
- `card.tsx` - Card containers
- And more...

### Utilities

**`lib/utils.ts`** - Helper functions
- Currently has `cn()` for merging Tailwind classes

**`lib/font.ts`** - Custom fonts
- Sets up the fonts we use (Hanken Grotesk, Dynapuff)

### Styling

We use **Tailwind CSS** for all styling. If you're not familiar with it, it's a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing separate CSS files, you add classes directly to your HTML/JSX.

For example:
```tsx
<div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg">
  Hello!
</div>
```

The classes mean: blue background, white text, padding of 4, and rounded corners. Pretty intuitive once you get the hang of it!

## Testing (Coming Soon)

Right now, we don't have automated tests set up yet, but here's what we're planning:

**Component Tests** - Test individual React components in isolation
**Integration Tests** - Test how components work together
**E2E Tests** - Test the full user flow from start to finish

For now, we're doing manual testing - just running the app and clicking around to make sure everything works. But as the project grows, we'll definitely want automated tests to catch bugs early.

If you want to set up testing, we'd recommend:
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for component tests
- **Playwright** or **Cypress** for end-to-end tests

Feel free to set this up if you're interested!

## When Things Go Wrong (Debugging)

We've all been there - something's not working and you're not sure why. Here are some common issues and how to fix them:

### Common Problems

**"Module not found" errors:**
- Usually means you forgot to install dependencies
- Fix: Run `pnpm install` again

**Port 3000 already in use:**
- Something else is running on that port
- Fix: Kill the other process or use a different port: `pnpm run dev -- -p 3001`

**Styles not updating:**
- Sometimes Tailwind needs a refresh
- Fix: Restart the dev server

**TypeScript errors:**
- Check the error message - it usually tells you what's wrong
- Common issues: wrong types, missing props, undefined values

**React hydration errors:**
- Usually happens when server and client HTML don't match
- Check for `useEffect` or browser-only code running on the server

### Debugging Tools

**Browser DevTools** - Your best friend!
- Open with F12 or right-click → Inspect
- Check the Console tab for errors
- Use the React DevTools extension to see component state
- Network tab shows API calls (when we add them)

**Console.log** - The classic debugger
```tsx
console.log('Current state:', state);
console.log('Props received:', props);
```
Just remember to remove these before committing!

**React DevTools** - See what's happening
- Install the React DevTools browser extension
- It shows you component hierarchy, props, and state
- Super helpful for understanding data flow

**VS Code Debugger** - For the serious stuff
- Set breakpoints in your code
- Step through execution line by line
- See variable values at each step

## Code Style & Best Practices

We want the codebase to be clean, readable, and consistent. Here's how we do things:

### Formatting

We use **Prettier** for automatic code formatting (it should be set up with the project). Before committing, make sure your code is formatted:

```bash
# If you have prettier installed globally
prettier --write .

# Or just let your editor format on save
```

Most editors can be configured to format on save, which is super convenient.

### Naming Conventions

**Components:** `PascalCase`
```tsx
// Good
export function HuntCard() { }
export const WalletModal = () => { }

// Bad
export function huntCard() { }
```

**Functions and variables:** `camelCase`
```tsx
// Good
const handleClick = () => { }
const userName = "John"

// Bad
const HandleClick = () => { }
const user_name = "John"
```

**Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
```tsx
// Good
const MAX_HUNTS = 10
const API_BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com"
```

**Files:** Match the component/function name
- Component files: `HuntCard.tsx`
- Utility files: `utils.ts`
- Type files: `types.ts`

### TypeScript

We use TypeScript for type safety. Always type your props and state:

```tsx
// Good
interface HuntCardProps {
  title: string
  description: string
  onComplete: () => void
}

export function HuntCard({ title, description, onComplete }: HuntCardProps) {
  // ...
}

// Bad
export function HuntCard(props: any) {
  // ...
}
```

### Component Structure

Keep components focused and small. If a component is getting too big, break it into smaller pieces:

```tsx
// Good - focused component
export function HuntCard({ hunt }: { hunt: Hunt }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{hunt.title}</h3>
      <p>{hunt.description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

// Bad - doing too much
export function HuntCard({ hunt }: { hunt: Hunt }) {
  // 500 lines of code doing everything
}
```

### Comments

Write comments that explain **why**, not **what**. The code should be self-explanatory:

```tsx
// Good
// We hash answers client-side before sending to prevent
// the contract from seeing plain text answers
const hashedAnswer = hashAnswer(userInput)

// Bad
// Hash the answer
const hashedAnswer = hashAnswer(userInput)
```

### React Best Practices

- Use functional components (we're using React 19)
- Use hooks for state management (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- Keep side effects in `useEffect`
- Don't forget dependency arrays in `useEffect`
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` when needed (but don't overuse)

## Deploying the App

When you're ready to share your work with the world, here's how to deploy:

### Building for Production

First, create an optimized production build:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This creates a `.next` folder with all the optimized code. If the build succeeds, you're good to go!

### Deployment Options

**Vercel** (Recommended - it's made by the Next.js team)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repo to Vercel
3. It automatically deploys on every push
4. Free for personal projects!

**Netlify**
- Similar to Vercel
- Also has automatic deployments
- Good alternative if you prefer it

**Self-hosting**
- Build the app: `pnpm run build`
- Start the server: `pnpm start`
- Point your domain to the server
- Use a process manager like PM2 to keep it running

### Environment Variables

Before deploying, make sure to set up environment variables for:
- Contract addresses (when we add them)
- API endpoints
- Wallet adapter configuration
- Any API keys

Create a `.env.local` file (don't commit this!) with your production values, or set them in your hosting platform's dashboard.

### Before You Deploy

Checklist:
- [ ] Code is linted and formatted
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] All environment variables are set
- [ ] Test the production build locally (`pnpm run build && pnpm start`)
- [ ] No console errors in the browser
- [ ] All features work as expected
